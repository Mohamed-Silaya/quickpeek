## üíª Setup & Running Locally

### 1. Backend (Django)

1. **Install requirements:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```

2. **Configure the Hugging Face token:**
    - Create a `.env` file in your backend directory:
      ```
      HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      ```

3. **Run the Django server:**
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    - The backend endpoint is available at:  
      [http://localhost:8000/summarize/](http://localhost:8000/summarize/)

### 2. Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to your React app folder.

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    - The app should open at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. User enters/pastes any chunk of text  
2. Frontend sends a POST request with the text to Django at `/summarize/`  
3. Backend safely forwards the request (with the private Hugging Face token) to the API and returns the summary  
4. The summary instantly appears on the page, ready to be copied
